# unmanned_surface_vehicles_path_following_algorithms
Four path following algorithms, including Carros Chasing algorithm, Nonlinear Guidance Law, Vector Field algorithm and Pure Pursuit and LOS algorithm, are developed for unmanned surface vehicle to follow a path precisely. For more details, please refer to my paper:  [Efficient Path Following Algorithm for Unmanned](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7485430)
